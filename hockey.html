            <dl>The Pakistan hockey team was given a heroic welcome on their arrival in Lahore on Sunday following their silver medal finish at the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, where they narrowly lost in the final to a defensively stoic Japanese side on penalties.

                Pakistan remained unbeaten en route to the final but were left ruing their missed opportunities in the final where Japan came from behind and floored them in a penalty shootout.
                
                Japan had taken an early lead but Roelant Oltmans’ side came back strongly with two goals in three minutes, only to relinquish their advantage before falling apart in the shootout.
                
                Upon arrival at Lahore, the team was greeted by a huge crowd, who presented the silver medalists’ with garlands and bouquets at the airport.
                
                Some fans were also seen holding placards and banners congratulating the team for their achievement against all odds.
                
                The hockey team was greeted at the airport by Chairman Prime Minister Youth Program Rana Mashhood, former Pakistan head coach Khawaja Junaid, HEC Director Javed Memon, former Olympian Akhtar Rasool, Shahbaz Senior and their family members.
                
                Upon the team’s return, Rana Mashhood said that Pakistan’s youth had reconnected with the national sport due to the performance of the hockey side.
                
                “We lost the match on penalty strokes otherwise these boys were unbeaten,” he said adding that the future of the sport had revived in the country.</dl>
